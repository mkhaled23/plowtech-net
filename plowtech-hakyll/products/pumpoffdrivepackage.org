* P.O.C. with drive
Accurate and up to the minute reports through Plow automation 

** For the highest production value
Plow automation offers a pump off control with a variable frequency drive. Unmanned,
the P.O.C. drive will automatically make adjustments to the depth of the pump when
needed. No over worked equipment cuts out repair costs.  More detailed information  
is accessible on site or off. Programmed range guidelines will
control the pump rate to maximize production. Proactive decisions can be made with 
daily real time reports. Saving costs on repairs and avoiding down time makes
a Plow P.O.C. drive package a great investment.  

** Benefits to a P.O.C. drive package
+ detection and control of pump off (fluid pound)
+ maximizing well production
+ minimizing power usage
+ protection of pumping system components
+ gross production measurement stored for 29-120 days

** Other benefits of an RPC include guarding against or detection of
+ leaking standing or traveling valves
+ tubing leaks
+ gas lock situations
+ rod parts /stuck or tight pumps
+ rod overload / under-load 
+ automatic restart after power failure
