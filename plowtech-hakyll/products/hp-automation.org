* Keep it flowing with a PLOW Hps package
  Heavy weather or simply time can unbalance your equipment. Plow technology programming can keep a consistent
water flow on a horizontal pump with calibration set by our team to your guidelines.  A sequential alarm 
system will occur when an inconsistency in the flow occurs. Our onping website can give you real time reports
to better decide on how to act to resolve the issue.     


** As an automation company we strive to simplify and increase efficiency in all your company needs.
The Hps automation package will include access to our onping website.  There you can make changes and adjustments
on sight or at home.  You will be given an easy to use and understand website with 24hr support for any other
issues.
