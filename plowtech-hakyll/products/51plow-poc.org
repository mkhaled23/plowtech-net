* Pump off control automation 
Access to accurate and timely information is the key to preventing an uninformed, costly decision.
** Opening a wider view of options with automated run well 
Pump off controllers are amazing devices for delivering peak performance for your
equipment. The RPC's gross fluid production calculation includes user-defined pump efficiency values 
for both deep and shallow wells as well as using the calculated down-hole pump stroke information
from host software analysis of deep wells.  Having this information available to you either on site 
or off, puts all the tools in your hand to flourish the potential of your well.  Turn to the experienced
technicians at PLOW for proper installation and configuration.
