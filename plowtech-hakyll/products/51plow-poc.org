* Pump off control automation 
Access to accurate and timely information is the key to preventing an uninformed, costly decision.
** Opening a wider view of options with automated run well 
Pump off controllers are amazing devices for delivering peak performance and production from your well.
The RPC's gross fluid production calculation includes user-defined pump efficiency values 
for both deep and shallow wells as well as using the calculated down-hole pump stroke information
from host software analysis of deep wells.  Having this information available to you either on site 
or off, puts all the tools in your hand to flourish the potential of your well.  Turn to the experienced
technicians at PLOW for proper installation and configuration.

Know the details of each stroke on your pump jack with PLOW automation. Having data available to you 
at any time while stored in cloud. Reach max pump off with PLOW. Automated, your pump will instantly 
make changes in depth and or speed.The shift would normally create spikes of power usage. with a poc
the changes are expected and made gradually to avoid  An alarm system in onping is linked to sensors and meters and activated
when an inconsistency occurs. Ask about our lighting for alarms.  Assign the team members to be contacted
if there is a problem on site. Worry not if the first contact is not available, onping will cycle through 
until a response is made. Onping is available on most portable devices.  Collecting the need to know 
information before you get to the site can save time and effort. With all that PLOW automation brings to 
your pump jack we still are available 24/7 for any technical support in onping.   



** The benefits of Pump Off Control
+ detection and control of pump off (fluid pound)
+ maximizing well production
+ minimizing power usage
+ protection of pumping system components
+ gross production measurement stored for 29-120 days

** Other benefits of an RPC include guarding against or detection of
+ leaking standing or traveling valves
+ tubing leaks
+ rod parts / stuck or tight pumps
+ gas lock situations
+ rod overload / under-load
+ automatic restart after power failure
