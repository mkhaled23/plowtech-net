*** Wind Turbine
** Uses the winds kinetic energy and turns it into electrical power.

Besides off grid operations there are other benefits to wind turbines. 
Losing power can create financial set backs with downtime. Having wind turbines
storing up power in batteries will keep your site up during these times. At
plow we like to suggest getting a solar panel to add another way of charging 
those batteries.  This hybrid design is great for areas with weather conditions 
that change rapidly. No grid connection requirements leaves the wind turbine 
open to be placed anywhere on site.   

Plow technology is constantly finding ways to simplify your industrial needs.
the newest addition is our wind turbine package that will provide an off grid 
power supply for constant energy or backup using batteries. Our team will set
up all equipment and provide you upon installation with any information you 
need.  Plow technology will still be there for any support after 24/7.
