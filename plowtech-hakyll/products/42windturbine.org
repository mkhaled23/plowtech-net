*** Wind Turbine
** Uses the winds kinetic energy and turns it into electrical power.

Besides off grid operations there are other benifits to wind turbines. 
Lossing power can create finacial set backs with downtime. Having wind turbines
storring up power in batteries will keep your site up durring these times. At
plow we like to suggest getting a solar panel to add another way of charging 
those batteries.  This hybrid design is great for areas with wheather conditions 
that change rapidly. No grid connection requirments leaves the wind turbane 
open to be placed anywhere on site.
