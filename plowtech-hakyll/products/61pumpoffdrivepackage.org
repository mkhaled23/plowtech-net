at any time while stored in cloud.  Reach max pump off with PLOW. Automated, your pump will instantly 
make changes in depth and or speed.  The shift would normally create a spike of power usage.  With a POC
the changes are expected and are made gradually to avoid this.  An alarm system in [[http:11onping][Onping]] is linked to sensors
and meters and activated when an inconsistent occurs.  Ask about our lighting feature for alarms.  Assign 
the team members to be contacted if there is a problem on site.  Worry not if the first contact is not
