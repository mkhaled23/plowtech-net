[[/assets/img/demo2.png]]
* Build your own automation site to fit your needs.
Use tables and graphical gauges to make your numbers come to life. You can control who sees what, and use that control to make your field better. Automation is about control, for the people that matter, in the field and in the office.
Automation is about answers. That means you need to control what you see.  Not us, not your IT department, *you*!
OnPing was built by people who needed an answer. It was built by  people who love easy.  Who love fast.  Who hate having to be told they have to wait to get what they need to do their job. 
That is what makes OnPing so different than other things out there.
